# Uploading Your Model

In this section, you will learn how to upload your packaged AI model to the AI Marketplace. Follow these steps to ensure a smooth upload and deployment process.

## Preparing Your Zip File
Ensure your project directory is correctly structured and includes all necessary files:

```
your_model/
├── Dockerfile
├── main.py
├── requirements.txt
└── utils.py  # Any additional files your model requires
```

Zip your project files:
```sh
zip -r your_model.zip .
```

## Uploading to the AI Marketplace
1. **Log in to Your Account:**
   Log in to your AI Marketplace account. If you do not have an account, you will need to create one.

2. **Navigate to the Model Upload Section:**
   Go to the section of the site where you can upload new models.

3. **Upload Your Zip File:**
   Click the upload button and select your zipped project file (`your_model.zip`).

4. **Provide Model Details:**
   Fill in the details about your model, including:
   - **Model Name:** A descriptive name for your model.
   - **Description:** A detailed description of what your model does.
   - **Input Types:** Define the input types your model accepts (refer to [Defining Input and Output Types](input_output_types.md)).
   - **Output Types:** Define the output types your model returns (refer to [Defining Input and Output Types](input_output_types.md)).

5. **Submit for Deployment:**
   Once you have filled in all the necessary information, submit your model for deployment. The AI Marketplace will handle the rest, automatically launching your model using Docker.

## Post-Upload Checklist
- **Test Your Deployed Model:**
  After your model is deployed, test it to ensure it works correctly in the production environment. Access the API endpoint provided by the AI Marketplace and verify the responses.

- **Monitor Your Model:**
  Keep an eye on the usage and performance of your model. The AI Marketplace may provide analytics and logs to help you monitor your model.

- **Update Your Model:**
  If you need to make updates or improvements to your model, repeat the process of packaging and uploading the new version.

## Troubleshooting
- **Upload Issues:**
  If you encounter issues while uploading your model, ensure your zip file is correctly structured and includes all necessary files.
  
- **Deployment Failures:**
  Check the logs provided by the AI Marketplace to identify any errors during deployment. Ensure your Dockerfile and FastAPI application are correctly configured.

- **API Errors:**
  If your API is not responding as expected, test it locally to debug any issues. Ensure all dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` and correctly installed.
